**Proof of Concept for a dApp Interacting with a Smart Contract on the Sepolia Testnet.**

The primary goal of this smart contract is to emulate, in a blockchain-based solution, the current process of maintaining the Fuel Movement Logbook ("Livro de Movimentação de Combustíveis" - LMC), which is filled out daily by fuel stations in Brazil.

Project developed as a final assignment for the course "Blockchain and Smart Contracts for Digital Transformation", which is a part of the Postgraduate Specialization Program "Master in Digital Transformation" offered by PUC-Rio.
