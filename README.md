**Demonstrating a Decentralized Application (dApp) Interaction with a Smart Contract on the Sepolia Testnet**

This project aims to digitally replicate the process of recording data in the Fuel Movement Logbook ("Livro de Movimentação de Combustíveis" - LMC), a daily requirement for Brazilian fuel stations, utilizing a blockchain framework.

This dApp was created as the capstone project for the "Blockchain and Smart Contracts for Digital Transformation" course, a key component of the "Master in Digital Transformation" Postgraduate Specialization Program at PUC-Rio.

Please note: This project serves as a Proof of Concept (PoC). The contract is public and permissionless, operating on a test network. For actual deployment, a private, permissioned, production network is recommended.
